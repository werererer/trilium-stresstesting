# trilium-stresstesting
Tools to stresstest trilium, to help proof it working at scale.

Still experimental, and subject to change a lot:

The goal is to test, if trilium can scale. Especially for personal/research interest

# Goals
Make reproducing errors on large scale databases for trilium more reproducible

# WIP
What still has to be done to make it useful?
